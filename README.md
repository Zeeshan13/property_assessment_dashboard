# Massachusetts Property Assessment Dashboard (2023)

This project is all about the art of storytelling with data. The goal is to craft visualizations that communicate effectively with different audiences by applying key design principles. Using Tableau, I have built an easy-to-use dashboard filled with various types of visuals that address specific business questions. These visuals not only represent the data accurately but also weave a cohesive narrative, emphasizing the importance of data-driven communication in contemporary data science.

## Introduction
In this project, I explore property assessments in Boston for the year 2023. The dataset is extensive, comprising 180,627 entries and 60 columns that capture a wide range of real estate information. This comprehensive Urban Insights Dashboard delves into Boston's real estate dynamics, land use patterns, and urban landscapes.

Through a series of carefully designed visuals, I aimed to answer critical business questions related to property distribution, building structures, and property values. The focus is on turning raw data into a compelling story that not only captures the attention of real estate professionals, investors, and urban planners but also provides strategic insights into Boston's urban real estate market.

## Key business questions include:

1. How does the distribution of property characteristics vary across different neighborhoods in Boston?
2. What insights can we gain about average property values and areas in these neighborhoods?
3. How do specific building features, such as structure types and roof materials, correlate with property values?
4. What are the dominant property types in Boston and surrounding areas?

The insights gained from this analysis can be useful for real estate professionals, urban planners, local government officials, property developers, and investors.

## Dashboard Overview
The Tableau dashboard provides the following visualizations:

**1. Land Use Distribution:** Proportions of residential, commercial, and tax-exempt properties across cities.

**2. Building Structure Analysis:** A breakdown of building types, structure materials, and associated property values.

**3. Geospatial Map:** Visualizes the geographic distribution of cities along with roof types, building numbers, and property values.

The dashboard is interactive, with tooltips offering additional insights when hovering over data points.
